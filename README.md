# Clover for Laptop Asus UX430 (KabyLake) - macOS 10.13+

## What's working now

- Trackpad has some minor bugs (random cursor jumping, etc.), but gestures are great
- Wifi/Bluetooth: replace with DW1560. Stock Intel card will never work
- Everything else works well

## Note

You should create your own SMBIOS information. Using the same SMBIOS information will likely cause your Apple ID to be locked.
